## How Waterfall-Fetch Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Try Axios}
    B -->|Success| C[Return HTML]
    B -->|Fail| D{Try Node-fetch}
    D -->|Success| C
    D -->|Fail| E{Try Puppeteer}
    E -->|Success| C
    E -->|Fail| F[Return Error]
```

This diagram illustrates the cascading approach of Waterfall-Fetch:

1. It starts with the fastest method (Axios).
2. If that fails, it moves to Node-fetch.
3. If Node-fetch fails, it uses Puppeteer as a last resort.
4. If all methods fail, it returns an error.

This intelligent, tiered strategy ensures that you're always using the most appropriate and efficient method for each unique scraping scenario, balancing speed, cost, and accuracy.
