# Custom Evaluation Functions

Waterfall-Fetch allows you to pass custom evaluation functions to be executed in the context of a web page when using Puppeteer. This is particularly useful for extracting specific data or interacting with JavaScript-heavy websites.

## Syntax

A custom evaluation function has the following signature:

```typescript
type OnPageEvaluationFunction = (page: Page) => Promise<any>;
```

Where `Page` is the Puppeteer `Page` object.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of using a custom evaluation function to extract the title of a page:

```typescript
import getHtml from "waterfall-fetch";

const url = "https://example.com";

const { html, evaluation_result } = await getHtml(url, {
	set: "js",
	evalFunction: async (page) => {
		return await page.evaluate(() => document.title);
	},
});

console.log("Page Title:", evaluation_result);
```

This function will be executed in the context of the web page after it has been loaded by Puppeteer.

## Use Cases

Custom evaluation functions are powerful tools for:

1. Extracting dynamic content
2. Interacting with JavaScript-rendered elements
3. Performing complex scraping tasks
4. Automating user interactions on a page
