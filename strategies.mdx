# Fetching Strategies

Waterfall-Fetch employs multiple strategies to retrieve HTML content, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. This page explains the different strategies and how they work together.

## Available Strategies

1. **Axios**: A fast and lightweight HTTP client
2. **Node-fetch**: A simple and modern fetch API for Node.js
3. **Stealth Puppeteer**: A headless browser for JavaScript-heavy sites

## Strategy Sets

Waterfall-Fetch uses two predefined strategy sets:

### 1. Cheap Set

Optimized for cost-effectiveness and speed:

1. Axios
2. Node-fetch
3. Puppeteer (as a last resort)

### 2. JS Set

Designed for JavaScript-heavy websites:

1. Puppeteer (with stealth mode)
2. Axios (as a fallback)
3. Node-fetch (as a final attempt)

## Waterfall Approach

The waterfall method starts with the fastest and most cost-effective strategy to fetch the HTML of your target URL. If the initial attempt fails, Waterfall-Fetch seamlessly transitions to more robust methods, ensuring you ultimately receive the HTML from the target URL.
